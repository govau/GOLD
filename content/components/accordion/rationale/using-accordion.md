heading: When to use accordions
---

Accordions should be viewed as a way to simplify and organise supporting information, not as a replacement for headings and paragraphs and should be used sparingly. 

Key information should be always be visible to users and not hidden in an accordion. Placing content inside accordions prevents the user from being an to use `Ctrl F` to search for specific content. It also interrupts a users abilty to scan the content of a page if it is hidden inside an accordion.
